# Email Automation 

## Tech stack
`Django` and `Python`, implementing the `Gmail API` for sending emails. `Postgres` is used as the DB.

## About the project
A simple email automation application that allows creating and sending emails with just two clicks.
You can create an email template, and then send this email to all users in your database.
Includes the use of **Models** to keep track of customers, email templates, and email activity.  Main emphasis in this project is using **Models** and managing **user authentication and authorization** throughout the application. 

## Next version
Currently working on adding additional data fields and more robust data queries to support complex customer analysis for marketing purposes.
